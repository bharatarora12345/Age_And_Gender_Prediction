* Open the "Training.ipynb" in your jupyter notebook, and if you want to train the model yourself, then run each cell one by one. <br>
* If you have trained the model yourself then ok, but if you want the model I have trained then download it.
* * Now when you have downloaded "model.h5" open the "Test.ipynb" in your jupyter notebook and run each cell one by one for testing the model.
